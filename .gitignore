Wait, I need to reconsider. Looking at the input again, only Python source files were added (`fetch_statscan_income.py`, `statscan_income_analyzer.py`) and a `.gitignore` file itself. No build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files were mentioned in the changes. According to rule #6, if the change list contains ONLY source or config files and NO build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output an EMPTY .gitignore.

Since only Python source files and the .gitignore file were added, with no build artifacts or dependencies present in the change list, the output should be empty.
